QUESTION:

Using the ruby documentation, determine how you can write large numbers in a way that makes them easier to
read.

ANSWER:

One way to write large numbers to increase readability for humans is to use an underscore to separate
digits: `1234` can also be expressed in Ruby as `1_234`.

NOTE: This information can be found under the topic of `literals`.
